\subsection{Detailed Description}
Observables are the various types on the fibers at the lattice sites.

The observable indices, including Reality (also known as complex or real), is represented as a tensor product over various vector spaces. Different kinds of object can transform in those vector spaces, like Scalar, Vector, and Matrix.

Primitives are the various types on the fibers at the lattice sites.

The primitive indices, including Reality (also known as complex or real), is represented as a tensor product over various vector spaces. Different kinds of object can transform in those vector spaces, like Scalar, Vector, and Matrix.
